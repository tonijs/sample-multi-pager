	<p>If you've come all the way to SoCal, you may want to set aside a little time to see some of the other many, many, MANY great things about the area.  All driving times below are approximate, and are in relation to downtown San Diego.</p>




<div class="clearfix">
<section class="north">

	<h3 class="north">To the North</h3>
	<p><strong>One hour from downtown</strong> : You're still in San Diego County! This is the region we call 'North County', which includes some great beach towns (Carlsbad and Oceanside), some heritage farmland (Escondido), and Camp Pendleton. Driving north on the I5 will take you through the beautiful undeveloped Marine base on towards San Clemente and the rest of Orange County.</p>

	<p><strong>Two hours from downtown</strong> : This is the OC. At some point you will hit Irvine, which is where the 5 and the 405 split. Take the 405 to stay along the coast, where there are some pretty posh little beaches and shopping districts. Take the 5 to head inland, to Disneyland, Knotts Berry Farms, and the Los Angeles Angels and the Mighty Ducks. Fun Fact : the Richard Nixon Memorial Library is in Orange County, if that's your kinda thing.</p>

	<p>More than two hours from downtown : Now you're in LA, baby! Head east to get to Hollywood, west to get to Santa Monica & Venice Beach. Since this is a guide to San Diego, I'm not going to tell you what's good and not in LA (hint : traffic is terrible, all the time, for no obvious reason). If you want to keep going north along the coast, stay on the 405 until you hit the 101 and take it north. Another hour or 2 will get you to Santa Barbara which is one of the most beautiful places on earth. If you took the 5, you might wind up in Pasadena, home of the Rose Parade and multiple little old ladies. Also a pretty nice place to spend an afternoon.</p>

	<h3 class="south">To the South</h3>
	<p>One hour from downtown : You're probably in line to get across the border to Mexico! Check with your rental agency about what they suggest as far as getting extra insurance to drive across the border - there are a lot of folks waiting in the area to sell you extra coverage, but you may not actually need it. Just on the other side is Tijuana, which has a bad reputation (not totally undeserved) but has some good points, too. Or just stay in your car and head south a little bit further...</p>

	<p>Two hours from downtown : Welcome to Baja California. At the far Southern tip of this peninsula lies the famous Cabo San Lucas, home to Sammy Hagar and about a billion tourists. Much close than that, though, are some pretty nice little beach towns where you can rent a hotel room or a cottage for a night, eat some amazing seafood, buy some fireworks, and basically chill out. You'll pass Rosarito first, but if you want something a bit bigger, keep going until you hit Ensenada. </p>


	<h3 class="east">To the East</h3>

	<p>One hour from downtown : This is where San Diego really shines. It is totally plausible to spend the morning on the beach, the afternoon in the mountains, and the evening in the desert. If it's winter, there might even be snow up in the mountains. To the northeast there's a little town called Julian, locally famous for fall apple picking and for being generally adorable. </p>

	<p>Two hours from downtown : Welcome to the Anza Borrego Desert! In the spring (particularly after a rainy winter) you might be in for a spectacular desert wildflower show; any time of year, the hiking and wildlife-spotting is pretty great. Just be sure to dress in layers, wear sunscreen, and bring a LOT of water. </p>

	<p>More than two hours : Well, shit, you might as well keep going until you hit Las Vegas, which is about a 5/6 hour drive northeast from San Diego. Really though, if you want to go to Vegas, just fly to Vegas.  If all you want to do is gamble, there are many, many local casinos to choose from, nearly all less than an hour from downtown.</p>

	<h3 class="west">To the West</h3>
	
	<p>Well, the only thing west of downtown is Coronado Island, which you can get to via a ferry just a few minutes away from Seaport Village. West of that is the ocean, so I hope you're a good swimmer.</p>

	<h3>An epic road trip</h3>
	<p>If you've got the time and the inclination, San Diego makes an awesome starting or ending point for the great California road trip : a long drive up PCH (the Pacific Coast Highway, also known as Highway One, or just the One). There are a couple of different routes you can take to get to the actual 'coast highway' part (the point of no return), and there are several neat things to see along the way up. Check a map, pick your faves, and give yourself plenty of time to enjoy each stop.</p>
	<p>Starting from the south and heading north, here are some of my favorite stops : </p>
	<ul class="pch">
		<li><a href="http://torreypine.org/">Torrey Pines State Park</a> in Del Mar. Best ocean views in San Diego, but there is a bit of hiking involved, if that's an issue.</li>
		<li>San Juan Capistrano, specifically, the mission. Famous for flocks of sparrows or something, I think.</li>
		<li>I'd bypass LA - to easy to get stuck in traffic, and really, there's so much to see in LA it really deserves a trip unto itself.</li>
		<li>Santa Barbara. Mentioned it before, here it is again. The pier is nice, and if you're into history, they've got a pretty well-preserved Mission</li>
		<li>Solvang. It's a little Dutch town on California's central coast. Why, I don't actually know! But if you like little blue and white knicknacks this is the place for you. Be warned, it's craaaazy busy on weekends and holidays and parking is a major pain in the ass.</li>
		<li>Hearst Castle in San Simeon. It's big, it's fancy, and they only have guided tours, so check the website for starting and ending times before you go.</li>
		<li>Past San Simeon you're committed to the coastal drive. It's long and windy and can make people carsick, but it's incredibly fun to drive on and the views are un-be-lievable. </li>
		<li>Elephant seals</li>
		<li>Big Sur, redwoods, yada yada</li>
		<li>Monterrey is on the other side of the mountains, where the road straightens out and heads back down to sea level. Famous for, of course, the Monterrey Aquarium; for any literary buffs, it's also home to the actual Cannery Row. Plus otters and whales and shit.</li>
