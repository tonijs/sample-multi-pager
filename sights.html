		<p class="accent">You probably have a limited amount of time and a certain set of priorities, so let's sort out the best things to see and do while you're here.</p>


		<h3>Typically Touristy</h3>
		<p>There are things in every city that locals consider a must-see for newcomers. If you're the type of traveler who wants to experience the most famous sights of a city, start here!</p>
		

		<p>Seaport Village - this is a great place to go for dinner and souvenir shopping, especially after dark. It's charming, it's right on the bay, and you'll get a great view of Pt Loma and Coronado from the boardwalk.  Nearby, you can catch the ferry that takes you across to Coronado Island. It's also very close to the cruise ship terminal, making it a great choice for quick day-trips for cruise passengers.</p>

		<p>Coronado Island - drive across the bridge, or take the ferry from downtown. If you want to check out the historic Hotel Del Coronado, you're probably better off driving - it's a bit of a walk from the ferry docks, or a pretty quick cab ride. Either way, it's an absolutely beautiful place. Lots of great trees, good food, and the hotel has an amazing beach just outside the doors. In the winter they'll sometimes set up an outdoor skating rink (despite the fact that it's rarely cold enough!) right on the beach. </p>

		<p>Old Town San Diego - this is San Diego's historic district, even though it's been extensively rebuilt and commercialized. You can still see quite a few historic buildings from the pre-USA era, and eat some decent mexican food while drinking a margarita the size of your head. This is also a great place to pick up some pretty unique souvenirs.  If you're lucky, you'll visit on a day when the <a href="http://www.sandiegoreader.com/weblogs/feast/2013/jul/05/the-tortilla-ladies-its-fresh-and-hot-on-san-diego/#">tortilla ladies of Cafe Coyote</a> are open for business. If, like many North Americans, you think you like flour tortillas better than corn because corn tortillas are dry and bland, <a href="http://www.cafecoyoteoldtown.com/cafe-coyote-tortilla-ladies/">these ladies will change your mind</a>.</p>

		<p>The <a href="http://www.citypass.com/southern-california">Southern California City Pass</a> is probably your best bet if you plan to do all of these things. </p>

		<h3>Sports and stuff</h3>
		<p>Surfing lessons, golfing (Torrey Pines & La Costa), 5/10Ks & marathons, paragliding, hiking, volleyball, Padres & Chargers, whale watching</p>

		<div class="clearfix">
		<h3>Cultural Highlights</h3>
		<p>The Old Globe, La Jolla Playhouse, Balboa Park Museums, Missions</p>

		</figure>
		<p>Museums - Balboa Park was built for the (???) Expedition, and most of the buildings from the fair still remain. They house various museums, from the San Diego Natural History Museum, the Museum of Man, and the Museum of Art. You could easily spend several days in the park just visiting museums and the nearby zoo, not to mention wandering through all the gardens and the various cultural and historical societies that now inhabit the rest of the buildings.</p>
		<p>Live music : pretty good scene in San Diego! My personal favorite venue is the <a href="http://bellyup.com/">Belly Up Tavern</a> in Solana Beach. You can park near the train station just up the street, head across the tracks for some pizza and beer at <a href="http://www.pizzaport.com/locations/pizza-port-solana-beach/">Pizza Port</a>, then head over for the show. If the timing works out, you might even be able to take the train there and back from downtown!</p>

		<div class="clearfix">
		<h3>Family Friendly</h3>
		<p>The Zoo & Safari Park, Legoland, Sea World, Children's museum, kid's beaches</p>
		<p>Sea World - In recent years Sea World has expanded quite a bit from being just a really big aquarium; they now have rides and rollercoasters and stuff too. I personally don't really like the fact that they keep giant mammals in itty bitty tanks, so I avoid this one, but kids love it.</p>
		<div class="tips">
			<h4>Tips from the Locals</h4>
			<p>I did an informal survey of friends and family and Sea World was the nearly unanimous pick for 'Most Overrated Tourist Attraction'. </p>
		</div>
		<p>Legoland - if you have kids under 12 this is probably going to be the highlight of the trip for them. The crazy lego sculptures are fascinating for kids of all ages, but most of the rides are targeted for younger kids. There's also an outlet mall nearby with some pretty safe chain restaurants if you don't want to shell out for overpriced bland theme-park food. (Canadians - a warning about Claim Jumper. The portion sizes will shock you and make you fear for the future of America.)</p>
		<img id="zoo" src="images/zoo-entrance.jpg" alt="">
		<p>The San Diego Zoo and Safari Park - the Zoological Society of San Diego operates these 2 very different, but both very awesome, zoos. One, the San Diego Zoo, is located close to downtown in beautiful Balboa Park. The Safari Park is about half an hour north, in Escondido, on the edge of an agricultural preserve, and is likely to be unlike any zoo you've ever visited. They sell 2-park combo passes so if you even think you might want to check out both, pick one up. </p>

		<h3>Local Faves</h3>
		<p>North Park & Hillcrest, PB/OB</p>
