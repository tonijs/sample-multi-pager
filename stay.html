		<p class="accent">Where to stay depends, in part, on what you want to do and how you want to get around town. If you're planning to rent a car, you can really stay anywhere! If you're relying on public transit or cabs, you should probably stay downtown - you can get to nearly all the prime tourist spots easily by trolley or taxi in 15-20 minutes. Downtown San Diego is relatively compact, too, so you can probably hit a lot of cool stuff just walking around!</p>

		<h3>Getting around</h3>

		<h4>Trolley</h4>
		<p>While San Diego does have a pretty decent bus system, if you're staying along the coast or within the typical tourist areas, you should take a ride on the trolley. You can actually take it from downtown allll the way to the border with Mexico (where you can walk across the pedestrian bridge to Tijuana, pick up a cab on the other side, and spend the day.) </p>


		<h4>Rental</h4>
		<p>Unless you're here for a convention or a very short trip, you're gonna need to rent a car. If you aren't going to set up international data on your phone, you'll also need to get the GPS (San Diego is full of hills and canyons and things that cut roads in half and can make getting around a little weird). Thankfully there are a TON of rental options near the airport, all with shuttle buses that will pick you up at the terminal.</p>

		<h3>Downtown</h3>
		<img id="grant" src="images/grant-hotel.jpg" alt="The US Grant Hotel in Dowtown San Diego">
		<p>Downtown is the obvious place to stay, given its proximity to both the airport, several freeways, and many major attractions. It's also, well, 'downtown' - meaning it's loud, a bit dirty, and pretty busy. Hotel choices downtown range from the very old (like the <a href="http://www.usgrant.net/">US Grant</a>, pictured left) to the hip and modern (<a href="http://www.thewsandiegohotel.com/">the W</a>).</p>


		<h3>Hotel Circle</h3>

		<p>Hotel Circle is, shall we say, retro. These are the old-school '50s and '60s style hotels, conveniently located close to all the major freeways.  The San Diego Trolley also has several stops nearby. Hotel Circle is ideal if you're looking for slightly cheaper but not sketchy accommodations that are still pretty darn convenient to most of the tourist attractions in town.  It is decidedly less walkable, though, so if you're won't have access to a car, this is not the place for you.</p>

		<h3>Point Loma / Sports Arena</h3>

		<p>Point Loma is where I generally stay, since most hotels there are a very short cab ride to the airport and are usually pretty darn cheap. With few exceptions, however, they're not particularly nice; if all you're looking for is a place to keep your stuff and catch a few z's between adventures, it's a solid choice. </p>

		<p>The exceptions to the general low-quality options can be found on Harbor & Shelter Islands. They're a bit more isolated, right on the water in some cases, with the only downside being they are really close to the airport and can get a bit noisy. Lindbergh Field doesn't allow commercial flights after about 11 PM, though, so it really isn't that noticeable. These hotels generally have pretty good restaurant options as well, and the islands themselves (well, they're actually man-made peninsulas) are nice places for a bike ride or a stroll.  Honorable mention here goes to <a href="http://www.halfmooninn.com/">Humphrey's</a>, especially if you're a music lover - during the summer they host a <a href="http://www.humphreysconcerts.com/">series of concerts</a> right on the water, and you'll almost always see folks sailing their boats up to the venue to listen.</p>

		<h3>Beaches</h3>

		<p>The beaches. There are so many, each with a different personality and the accommodations to match. If you're looking for a true beach-bum experience, look into renting one of the many apartments or condos along the Mission Beach boardwalk. The <a href="https://hoteldel.com/">Hotel Del Coronado</a> (known to locals as the Hotel Del, pictured above) is probably the best choice for a special-occasion hotel - honeymoon, birthday, anniversary, whatever. </p>
