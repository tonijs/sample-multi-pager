	<p class="accent">While there's lots of great stuff that happens year round, each season offers something different. Here are my picks for your best bet for each.</p>

	<h2>Winter</h2>
	<p>Winter is pretty great, especially if you're coming from one of the northern states or Canada. It's not uncommon for it to drop close to freezing overnight, but warm up to nearly 20 degrees by noon. Those swings lead to some crazy fog sometimes, and you might see the locals wearing winter coats, hats, and scarves, but compared to a Canadian winter it's practically balmy. If you're one of those people who thinks white Christmases are overrated, December is a great time to visit. A lot of the local attractions have special evening hours with light displays, there's a 'christmas lights on boats' parade out in the harbor, and of course, the best weather ever. Not to mention spending New Year's day on the beach is pretty special.</p>

	<p>Winter highlight : if you plan right, you can spend the morning up at nearby <a href="http://www.bearmountain.com/">Bear Mountain</a> or <a href="http://www.snowsummit.com/">Snow Summit</a>, skiing or boarding, and spend the evening on the beach watching the surfers (or surfing yourself!) In San Diego, it's totally possible.</p>

	<h2>Spring</h2>
	<p>Spring in San Diego is generally pretty warm and sunny - for a few months, anyway. Here's a thing that surprises just about everyone who visits San Diego in June : it's cold. And damp. Southern California's unique geography creates all kinds of fun weather patterns, and 'June Gloom' is one of them. Typically, days in June (sometimes starting in May, bleeding into July) start off chilly and overcast as the marine layer rolls in from the ocean overnight, sometimes burning off by the afternoon, sometimes not. Just be prepared and wear layers.</p>

	<h3>Spring events</h3>
	<p>I think the most significant event in Spring is probably the start of baseball season. Or maybe Spring Break, if you're into that kinda thing.</p>

	<p>The San Diego County Fair usually starts in early/mid June, just before summer technically starts. It's a pretty decent fair - lots of fried foods, farm animals, weird 'as seen on TV' garbage to buy, and some decent bands playing in the evenings. They often have fun stuff on weekends, like a chili cook-off or a craft beer festival, so check the website to see if there's anything of interest.</p>

	<h2>Summer</h2>
	<p>Summer is the obvious time to visit; it's peak vacation period for most. While the weather in San Diego allows for stuff to happen basically whenever, the biggest and best tend to happen in the summer.  However: if you're the kind of person who thinks 24C is just waaay too hot to deal with, maybe skip summertime and visit in Spring or Fall, instead.</p>

	<h3>Summer Events</h3>
	
	<p>Starting in early July, the races at the Del Mar Racetrack start. If you're a fan of horse racing or just gambling in general, it's a thing to do.  I usually just go for the free concerts they have there on Friday evenings.</p>

	<p>Everyone knows about Comic Con. Sometime in July, an incredible number of nerds show up and take over downtown. If you want to book a hotel ANYWHERE near the downtown core, make sure you either do it well in advance, or avoid this week altogether. If you do happen to find yourself in town during the Con, though, take advantage! There is almost always enough free stuff happening around the Convention Center to occupy nearly a full day; not to mention, if you grab a seat on one of the patios in the Gaslamp, you're in for a people-watching treat.</p>

	<p>A less well-known event outside of the city, but crazy popular with the locals, is the <a href="http://www.ombac.org/over-the-line/">OMBAC OTL</a> tournament. If you aren't from Southern California you will probably have no idea what any of that means, but in a nutshell, OTL (over-the-line) is stripped-down softball, played with a minimum of 3 players per team, perfectly suited to drinking beer on a beach. Check it out if you're in town, but leave the kids at home - it can get a bit raunchy.</p>

	<p>street festivals</p>

	<h2>Fall</h2>

	<p>If you're looking for Fall colors, try New England. Or be prepared to spend some time up in the nearby mountains. Trees in California DO change colors, but given that the majority of trees don't actually drop their leaves over the winter, the displays of color are pretty isolated (I'm talking 2 or 3 trees in a park somewhere surrounded by some stubbornly green eucalyptus trees). That being said, there is some good stuff going on in Fall, and it has the advantage of being a pretty low-tourist season. </p>

	<h3>Fall Events</h3>

	<p>The best thing, in late September/early October, is the <a href="http://www.julianca.com/apple-days.html">Julian Apple Festival</a>.  I recommend a day out in Julian regardless of the season, but it can seem a bit slow at other times of the year.</p>

	<p>With Fall in Southern California comes a fun weather pattern known as a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Santa_Ana_winds">Santa Ana</a>. Basically, hot dry air from the deserts comes rushing over the top of the mountains and causes some seriously hot, dry, windy weather for a few days. </p>

	<h2>How to get here? </h2>
	<p>fly : SAN, LAX, Orange County, Vegas & drive</p>
	<p>from Vancouver, you could drive, I guess? or Amtrak</p>
